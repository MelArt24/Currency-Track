# Currency Track

Currency Track is an application with a simple interface that allows you to find out the current exchange rate of currencies, namely the dollar and the euro, by receiving data via API from the servers of the specified financial institutions.

Currently, only the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and PrivatBank have official APIs that allow you to get the current exchange rate of the dollar and euro to the hryvnia - Ukrainian national currency.
